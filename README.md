FashionBrain D2.1: Named Entity Recognition and Linking Methods
EU project 732328: "Fashion Brain"

In this repository, we provide a natural language processing tool called FashionNLP which is specially designed for fashion textual data. This tool extends existing state of the art NER technique to fashion application. More specifically, FashionNLP has three main components: NER, where fashion entities are recognized on textual data, NEL, where we link the fashion entity to the FashionBrain taxonomy and finally, in case the fashion entity does not exist in the FashionBrain taxonomy, we add it to the taxonomy.
